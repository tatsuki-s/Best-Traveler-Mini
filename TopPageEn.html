                <h2>Background of this site's establishment</h2>
                <p>
                    &nbsp;Suddenly, have you ridden a bus since you came to Japan?<br/>
                    &nbsp;In recent years, the number of public transportation services in rural areas has been decreasing year by year due to the shortage of drivers and other factors.<br/>
                    &nbsp;However, the loss of buses is expected to cause a variety of problems.<br/>
                    &nbsp;Elderly drivers may be forced to drive cars even if they are overworked, and traffic accidents may occur.<br/>
                    &nbsp;Tourists may give up sightseeing because of lack of transportation.<br/>
                    &nbsp;&quot;BEST&nbsp;TRAVELER.&quot; was developed to solve these problems.                    
                </p>
            
            <div>
                <h2>Functions of this site</h2>
                <div class="kinou">
                    <h3>(1) Bus timetables are available everywhere!</h3>
                    <p>
                        &nbsp;ou cannot see the timetable of a bus stop unless you visit the bus stop, but with this site, you can view the timetable of each bus stop anytime, anywhere.<br/>
                        &nbsp; see the times of the previous and following buses, making it easy to plan your outings.
                    </p>
                    <h3>(2) Thto of the bus stop so you won't get lost!</h3>
                    <p>
                        &nbsp;Have you ever been lost at a bus stop? By using our site, you will never get lost at a bus stop again!<br/>
                        &nbsp;Since buses run in two directions, there are two bus stops. Therefore, you may not be able to locate the bus stop even if you check the map.<br/>
                        &nbsp;However, this site has photos of the area around the bus stop, making it easy to find even the most inconspicuous bus stop.
                    </p>
                    <h3>(3) You can see the surrounding area!</h3>
                    <p>
                        &nbsp;When you arrive at the bus stop unexpectedly early, isn't it tiring to stand in front of the bus stop all the time?<br/>
                        &nbsp;If you visit the top page of any of these bus stops on our website, we will show you the best nearby attractions so you can spend some time there and perhaps even meet someone new around the bus stop.
